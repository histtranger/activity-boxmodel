        <h1>Doctor Who</h1>
        <p>Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television program produced by the BBC.</p>
        
        <p>The program depicts the adventures of the Doctor, a Time Lordâ€”a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilizations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.</p>
